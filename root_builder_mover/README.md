Hello.

This is a GUI tool to suppliment Mod Organizer's root_builder plugin. It moves files and folders that belong in the "root" folder into the "root" folder of every mod, creating such a directory it is required and is missing.

The tool supports game profiles and some config, all done in GUI. Profiles for Cyberpunk 2044, Skyrim and Fallout are provided. All you'll need to do is to set the path to the "mods" folder in your Mod Organizer's profile folder for the respective game.

Have fun.
